This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust related to mutable and immutable borrows. The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to use an immutable reference after creating a mutable reference to the same value.  The `bugSolution.rs` demonstrates how to correctly handle this situation. This is a great example to illustrate the compiler's helpful error messages and the benefits of Rust's strong memory management features.
